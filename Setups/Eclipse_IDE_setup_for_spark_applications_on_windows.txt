Install eclipse
Make sure you have scala plugin installed in eclipse
Make sure scala compiler is set to scala-2.11  (project > build path > configure build path > scala compiler)

Add sparks jars so that your code can compile (project > build path > configure build path > java build path > llibraries > add external jar )
--point to <SPARK_HOME/jars>

--if running in local mode(optional)
Make sure your conf points to master as local within your code
go to run confiurations> and under environment tab click on new and add
SPARK_LOCAL_IP
127.0.0.1

--refer files for Spark Local setup on windows/linux in repo
--refer files for Hadoop setup on windows/linux in repo (for Spark on YARN)


Write your code(scala/spark)
Run your application from IDE against local mode.

Note** build.sbt can be added to your project, in case you intend to use SBT to package code as 
   JAR to run on a hadoop cluster using spark-submit.
       In this case download SBT on your machine, add build.sbt <provided in link> to your project,
       write your code [for your code to compile you can add spark
       jars to the build path and set your scala compiler to scala-2.11 build.
       From cmd line, go into your project directory, give a command 'sbt package' 
       which packages your code into jar and then this jar can be moved to cluster.
       For running spark application on cluster refer - "Running Spark Applications on Cluster"
       
If not using SBT, then we dont need sbt or build.sbt setup. Just spark related jars in build path, code in eclipse and environment variables set .

once 'sbt package' is done, a Target folder is created under Spark project , which will contain *.jar (containing packaged applications)
